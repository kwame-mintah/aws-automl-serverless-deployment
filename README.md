# AWS AutoMLOps Serverless Deployment

This repository contains the serverless deployment yaml for lambda functions used to achieve [MLOps Level 2 within AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/mlops/#seo-faq-pairs#how-to-implement-mlops-in-the-organization). Not all resources
are created by this deployment in AWS, some resources are created via Terraform in this repository [terraform-aws-machine-learning-pipeline](https://github.com/kwame-mintah/terraform-aws-machine-learning-pipeline) repository.

The lambda functions deployed aim to automate, preparing data and transforming features, training and tuning, deploying models and running inferences etc.

# Architecture

![proposed-automlops-level-2](/docs/drawio/aws-automlops-deployment.png)

1. User has received new data.
2. Data is uploaded to a GitHub repository.
3. A GitHub action is triggered uploading the data to an S3 Bucket.
4. Lambda function for data preprocessing is run due to an event trigger on the bucket.
5. Upon completion the transform data is uploaded to another bucket.
6. Lambda function to start the training job is started due to an event trigger on the bucket.
7. Training job is started using data split for train, test and validation purposes.
8. Completed model is uploaded to an S3 Bucket.
9. Lambda function to deploy the new model for inference and evaluation etc.

## Lambda repositories

The source code for all lambda functions are stored in GitHub:

- dataPreProcessing: [aws-lambda-data-preprocessing](https://github.com/kwame-mintah/aws-lambda-data-preprocessing)
- modelTraining: [aws-lambda-model-training](https://github.com/kwame-mintah/aws-lambda-model-training)
- modelDeployment: [aws-lambda-model-deployment](https://github.com/kwame-mintah/aws-lambda-model-deployment)
- modelEvaluation: [aws-lambda-model-evaluation](https://github.com/kwame-mintah/aws-lambda-model-evaluation)

## GitHub Action (CI/CD)

The GitHub Action will deploy the lambda functions using the [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/github-action) action. Docker images used for deployment are stored
within an AWS ECR repository.

## Note

This repository is to serve as an example, the architecture provided may not apply to all use cases due to the limitations of lambdas. Please consider other AWS services,
for instance Elastic Container Service (ECS), for much better performance and longer running tasks. As the MLOps workflow has been split into various components,
it should be easy to identify areas that could benefit to being moved to a different service with better compute.
